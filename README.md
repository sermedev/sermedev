### Hola corazones

I'm a consultant and .NET developer focused on the implementation of solutions related to content management.

I have been working for leading companies in their sectors, initially in the area of digitalization and process automation tools (Kofax, KTA, ReadSoft, SAP IM) and currently on the development of products for all areas of homeland security (.Net, C#, WPF).

I love it and I make my own slogan "Never stop learning".
